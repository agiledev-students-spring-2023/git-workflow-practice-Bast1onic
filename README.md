### **Discussion**:
Much of the general discussion about recent notable achievements in generative AI such as Dall-E and ChatGPT has been apprehensive about its eerily human-accurate creations, their ease of use, and their potential to displace human operators in "high-skill" fields of expertise previously thought to be untouchable by AI. One such field is, ironically enough, one which helped give rise to such generative AI itself--software development. ChatGPT is capable of producing, among other textual constructs, working computer code that adheres to the specifications of the prompt used to generate it; comments, styling, and even debugging are all within ChatGPT's capabilities.

This article, however, takes a more nuanced approach to ChatGPT and its (potential) role in software development. It acknowledges ChatGPT's limitations and suggests "augmentation", not replacement, as another possible future--ChatGPT can be used as a tool to help developers work more efficiently. And this is not an entirely unreasonable suggestion; software development is, in some aspects, an exercise in automation, so it wouldn't make sense for development itself to be fully automated anytime in the near, forseeable future.
